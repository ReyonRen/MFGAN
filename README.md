## Introduction
In this paper, we have proposed a Multi-Factor Generative Adversarial Network (MFGAN) for sequential recommendation. In our
framework, the generator taking user behavior sequences as input is
used to generate possible next items, and multiple factor-specific discriminators are used to evaluate the generated sub-sequence from
the perspectives of different factors.

## Setup
This code is based on [SASREC](https://github.com/kang205/SASRec).

### Requirements
* Tensorflow 1.2.0
* Python 3.6

### Data

For the training data of the generator, each line contains an user id and item id meaning an interaction. 

As for the training data of the discriminators, it contains n files if the dataset have n attributes. In an attribute file, each line contains an attribute of a item, which depends on how the attribute information defined.


## Model training
`python main.py --dataset="generator training set name" --train_dir=default`
